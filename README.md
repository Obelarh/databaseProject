<!-- Description of what the project does -->
DESCRIPTION
This project is a Database Management System (DBMS) designed for a university to store, manage, and retrieve student-related information efficiently. The system follows the rules of database normalization (up to 3NF) to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity.

It includes several interrelated tables that handle:

Student personal details

Academic records

Course registrations

Departments and faculty information

Grade reporting
